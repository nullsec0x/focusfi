Hey you! Yeah, you - the one who opened 15 tabs of "how to be productive" while avoiding actual work. Welcome to **FocusFi**, the productivity dashboard built by a procrastinator for procrastinators.

## What's This?

FocusFi is your all-in-one dashboard to *pretend* you're being productive while you're actually just customizing your theme for the 47th time today. It's got:

- ‚è∞ A fancy clock (so you know exactly how late you are)
- üìù Task management (to ignore your responsibilities in an organized way)
- üé® Mood-based themes (because productivity is ~aesthetic~)
- üí™ Motivational quotes (to make you feel guilty about not working)
- üçÖ Pomodoro timer (that you'll start and then immediately pause)
- üåô Dark mode (for those late-night cram sessions)

## Installation (For When You Finally Decide to Try It)

1. **Clone this bad boy**  
   Open terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nullsec0x/FocusFi.git
   cd FocusFi
   ```
   (No Git? Just download the ZIP file and unzip it like a normal person)

2. **Open index.html**  
   Double-click it. Use Chrome/Firefox. Don't even think about Internet Explorer.

3. **Profit**  
   Congrats! You've successfully installed another distraction tool.

## Why Use This?

Let's be real - you were gonna download 5 different apps for this stuff anyway. Now you can have it all in one place while maintaining the illusion that you're "optimizing your workflow."

## Features Breakdown

### The "I'm Definitely Working" Features
- **Focus Mode**: Hides everything except your tasks. Perfect for when someone walks by your desk.
- **Task List**: Add, complete, and delete tasks. The deleting part is the most satisfying.
- **Stats Tracker**: Watch your "completed tasks" number go up while your actual productivity stays the same.

### The "Productive Procrastination" Features
- **Theme Customizer**: Spend hours picking the perfect color scheme instead of working.
- **Motivational Quotes**: Get inspired to work... right after you check just one more meme.
- **Pomodoro Timer**: 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of break (let's be honest, it's more like 5 minutes of work, 25 minutes of break).

## How to Actually Use It

1. Open the dashboard
2. Spend 20 minutes customizing your name and mood
3. Add all your tasks
4. Get distracted by the theme colors
5. Realize you've been "setting up" for an hour
6. Repeat tomorrow

## For Developers (Or Wannabe Developers)

Tech stack is simple because we're not trying to win any awards here:
- HTML/CSS/JS - the holy trinity of web dev
- LocalStorage - to remember your tasks (until you clear your browser data)
- Font Awesome - for those sweet, sweet icons
- Google Fonts - because default fonts are boring

## About the Creator

Made by [Nullsec0x](https://github.com/nullsec0x) (that's me!) when I should've been studying. If you find any bugs... well, they're probably features. 

## Final Thoughts

Will this actually make you productive? ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  
But it'll make *feeling* productive way more fun.

Now go forth and... actually do something maybe? Or just keep customizing your dashboard. Your call.
